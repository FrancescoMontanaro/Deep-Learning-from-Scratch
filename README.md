# Deep Learning from Scratch

This repository provides implementations of deep learning models, leveraging frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. The objective is to offer a structured environment for understanding and experimenting with modern deep learning architectures.

## Models Included

- **GPT-2**: An implementation of the GPT-2 language model, utilizing attention mechanisms and transformer-based architectures.
- **Transformer**: A transformer model designed for language modeling, incorporating key deep learning concepts such as self-attention and feed-forward networks.

Each model is accompanied by training pipelines and example datasets, allowing users to explore and experiment with deep learning methodologies.
